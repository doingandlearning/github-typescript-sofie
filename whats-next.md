Learning TypeScript doesn’t have to stop here! To help you continue building confidence and skills, I’ve put together a set of resources and ideas.

Here’s what you’ll find:

1. **TypeScript Reference Docs** – Essential tools for looking up syntax and experimenting with code.
2. **Learning TypeScript** – Courses, books, and challenges to deepen your understanding.
3. **Practical Projects & Practice Ideas** – Small, real-world tasks to apply TypeScript in meaningful ways.

> “Pick one of your day-to-day tasks and ask: could I script part of this with TypeScript?”

## 🧭 1. TypeScript Reference

These are the go-to sources for looking up syntax, types, and compiler behaviours:

- [TypeScript Handbook (Official)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)  
  The official, clear, and thorough guide. Great for specific questions.

- [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)  
  Try out snippets and see type errors live — very helpful for experimenting safely.

## 📚 2. Learning TypeScript – If You Want to Go Further

If learners are keen to grow as developers or work more directly with code:

- **Beginner-Friendly Courses**:
  - [TypeScript for Beginners – freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwuLxPH8IDs) *(video)*
  - [TypeScript Fundamentals – Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript)

- **Structured Books**:
  - *TypeScript for Beginners* by Stefan Baumgartner – very readable, clear examples
  - *TypeScript Quickly* by Yakov Fain – moves from basics to real-world usage

- **Interactive**:
  - [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)  
    Fun, puzzle-like exercises to test and deepen your understanding of the type system.

## 🛠️ 3. Practical Projects & Practice Ideas

Small ways to keep applying TypeScript in your day-to-day context (even without full dev work):

### 💡 Studio/Schema Automation Ideas
- Write a script to check for missing required fields in a schema.
- Build a validator using Zod or simple functions to validate config files.
- Extend an existing schema by safely combining base and overrides.
- Write a tool to diff two config files and highlight changed fields.

### 🔧 Small Real-World Projects
- Create a personal config manager: e.g., audio settings per studio, typed and validated.
- Write a CLI script (using `ts-node`) to rename or update fields in a set of config files.
